/**
 * The temporary collection keeps track of the global collection of
 * temporary cleanup tasks in instances where temporary-generating
 * tasks are executed directly via their run() method, rather than
 * as part of a collection.
 *
 * In general, temporary-generating tasks should always be run in
 * a collection, as the cleanup functions registered with the
 * Temporary collection will not run until requested.
 *
 * Since the results could be undefined if cleanup functions were called
 * at arbitrary times during a program's execution, cleanup should only
 * be done immeidately prior to program termination, when there is no
 * danger of cleaning up after some unrelated task.
 *
 * An application need never use Temporary directly, save to
 * call Temporary::wrap() inside loadTasks or loadShortcuts, and
 * to call Temporary::complete() immediately prior to terminating.
 * This is recommended, but not required; this function will be
 * registered as a shutdown function, and called on termination.
