Drupal 8.4.x, xxxx-xx-xx
------------------------
### Drush users: Update to Drush 8.1.12

[Versions of Drush earlier than 8.1.12 will not work with Drupal 8.4.x](https://www.drupal.org/node/2874827).
Update Drush to 8.1.12 before using it to update to Drupal core 8.4.x or you
 will encounter fatal errors.

### Updated browser requirements: Internet Explorer 9 and 10 no longer supported

In April 2017, Microsoft discontinued all support for Internet Explorer 9 and
10. Therefore, [Drupal 8.4 has as well](https://www.drupal.org/node/2897971).
Drupal 8.4 still mostly works in these browser versions, but bugs that affect
them only will no longer be fixed, and existing workarounds for them will
be removed beginning in Drupal 8.5.

Additionally, Drupal 8's [browser requirements documentation page](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/system-requirements/browser-requirements)
currently lists incorrect information regarding very outdated browser versions
such as Safari 5 and Firefox 5. [Clarifications to the browser policy and documentation](https://www.drupal.org/node/2390621)
are underway and we hope to finalize it before 8.4.0-rc1.

### Known Issues

* Drupal 8.4.0-alpha1 includes major version updates for two dependencies:
  Symfony 3.2 and jQuery 3. Both updates may introduce backwards compatibility
  issues for some sites or modules, so test carefully.
  For more information, see the "Third-party library updates" section below.
* [Modal tour tips provided by the Tour module are not displayed correctly](https://www.drupal.org/node/2898808)
  because the third-party Joyride library has an incompatibility with jQuery 3.
  Tour tips are no longer centered and may be displayed entirely off-screen for
   many screen sizes. Work is underway on an upstream bug fix.
* Some sites that have files with 0 recorded usages may encounter
  [validation errors when saving content referencing these files](https://www.drupal.org/node/2896480).
  If your site's users report errors when saving content, you can
  [set the `file.settings.make_unused_managed_files_temporary` setting to `true`](https://www.drupal.org/node/2891902),
  but make sure you also set "Delete orphaned files" to "Never" on
  `/admin/config/media/file-system`
  to avoid permanent deletion of the affected files.

### Important fixes since 8.3.x

Translators should take note of several [string additions and changes since the last release](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&issue_tags_op=%3D&issue_tags=String+change+in+8.4.0).

#### File usage tracking

Drupal 8 has several longstanding [file usage tracking
bugs](https://www.drupal.org/node/2821423). To prevent further data loss,
Drupal 8.4 has [disabled the automatic deletion of files with no known remaining usages](https://www.drupal.org/node/2801777).
This will result of the accumulation of unused files on sites, but ensures that
files erroneously reporting 0 usages are not deleted while in use.
[The change record explains how sites can opt back into marking files temporary](https://www.drupal.org/node/2891902).
If you choose to enable the setting, you can also set "Delete orphaned files"
to "Never" on `/admin/config/media/file-system` to avoid permanent deletion of
the affected files.

While the files will no longer be deleted by default, file usage is still not
tracked correctly in several scenarios, regardless of the setting. Discussion
on [how to evolve the file usage tracking system](https://www.drupal.org/node/2821423)
is underway.

#### Configuration export sorting

* [#2361539: Config export key order is not predictable for sequences, add orderby property to config schema](https://www.drupal.org/node/2361539)
  resolves an issue where sequences in configuration were not sorted unless
  the code responsible for saving configuration explicitly performed a sort.
  This resulted in unpredictable changes in configuration ordering and
  confusing diffs even when nothing had changed. To resolve this issue, we've
  [added an `orderby` key to the config schema](https://www.drupal.org/node/2852566)
  that allows it to be sorted either by key or by value. Adding a preferred
  sort is strongly recommended.
* Two related issues remain open:
    * [#2860531: Add orderby key to third party settings](https://www.drupal.org/node/2860531)
      relates to unsorted sequences which result in unexpected discrepancies
      in configuration during a configuration import.
    * [#2885368: Config export key order for sequences: "orderedby" does not support cases where the order actually matters](https://www.drupal.org/node/2885368)
      relates to various sequences in core and contributed modules in which
      the source order is important.

#### Revision data integrity fixes

* Previously, data from draft revisions for [path aliases](https://www.drupal.org/node/2856363),
  [menus](https://www.drupal.org/node/2858434), and [books](https://www.drupal.org/node/2858431)
  could leak into the live site. Drupal 8.4.0-alpha1 hotfixes all three issues
  by preventing changes to this data from being saved on any revision that is
  not the default revision. These fixes improve revision support for both
  stable features and the experimental Content Moderation module.
* Correspondingly, [Content Moderation now avoids such scenarios with non-default revisions](https://www.drupal.org/node/2883868)
  by setting the 'default revision' flag earlier.
* Previously, [saving a revision of an entity translation could cause draft revisions to go "missing"](https://www.drupal.org/node/2766957).
  Drupal 8.4. prevents this by preventing the moderation state from being set
  to anything that would make the revision go "missing".
  [A similar but unrelated bug in Content Moderation](https://www.drupal.org/node/2862988)
  has also been fixed in this release.

### New stable modules

The following modules, previously considered experimental, are now stable and
safe for use on production sites, with full backwards compatibility and upgrade
paths from 8.4.0 to future releases:

#### Datetime Range

The [Datetime Range module](https://www.drupal.org/node/2893128) provides a
field type that allows end dates to support contributed modules like
[Calendar](https://www.drupal.org/project/calendar). This stable release is
backwards-compatible with the 8.3.x experimental version and shares a
consistent API with other Datetime fields.

Future releases may improve Views support, usability, Datetime Range field
validation, and REST support. For bugs or feature requests for this
module, [see the core Datetime issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&status%5B%5D=Open&version%5B%5D=8.x&component%5B%5D=datetime.module&issue_tags_op=%3D).

#### Layout Discovery

The [Layout Discovery module](https://www.drupal.org/node/2834025) provides
an API for modules or themes to register layouts as well as five common
layouts. Providing this API in core enables
core and contributed layout solutions to be compatible with each other. This
stable release is backwards-compatible with the 8.3.x experimental version
and introduces [support for per-region attributes](https://www.drupal.org/node/2885877).

#### Media

The new core [Media module](https://www.drupal.org/node/2831274) provides an
API for reusable media entities and references. It is based on the contributed
[Media Entity module](https://www.drupal.org/project/media_entity).

Since there is a rich ecosystem of Drupal contributed modules built on Media
Entity, the top priority for this release is to
[provide a stable core API and data model](https://www.drupal.org/node/2895059)
for a smoother transition for these modules. Developers and expert
site builders can now add Media as a dependency. Work is underway to
[provide an update path for existing sites' Media Entity data](https://www.drupal.org/node/2880334)
and to [port existing contributed modules to the refined core API](https://www.drupal.org/node/2860796).

Note that **the core Media module is currently marked hidden** and will not
appear on the 'Extend' (module administration) page. (Enabling a contributed
module that depends on the core Media module will also enable Media
automatically.) The module will be displayed to site builders normally once
user experience issues with it are resolved in a future release.

Similarly, the REST API and normalizations for Media is not final and support
for decoupled applications will be improved in a future release.

#### Inline Form Errors

The [Inline Form Errors module](https://www.drupal.org/node/2897652) provides a
summary of any validation errors at the top of a form and places the individual
error messages next to the form elements themselves. This helps users
understand which entries need to be fixed, and how. Inline Form Errors was
provided as an experimental module from Drupal 8.0.0 on, but it is now stable
and polished enough for production use. See the core
[Inline Form Errors module issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?text=&status=Open&priorities=All&categories=All&version=All&component=inline_form_errors.module)
for outstanding issues.

### Content authoring and site administration improvements

* The "Save and keep (un)published" dropbutton has been replaced with [a "Published" checkbox and single "Save" button](https://www.drupal.org/node/2068063).
  The "Save and..." dropbutton was a new design in Drupal 8, but users found it
  confusing, so we have restored a design that is more similar to the user
  interface for Drupal 7 and earlier.
* Previously, deleting a field on a content type would also delete any views
  depending on the field. While the confirmation form did indicate that the
  view would be deleted, users did not expect the behavior and often missed the
  message, leading to data loss.
  [Now, the view is disabled instead](https://www.drupal.org/node/2468045). In
  the future, we intend to
  [notify users that configuration has been disabled](https://www.drupal.org/node/2832558)
  (as in this fix) as well as
  [give users clearer warnings for other highly destructive operations](https://www.drupal.org/node/2773205).
* The [Drupal toolbar no longer flickers](https://www.drupal.org/node/2542050)
  during page rendering, thus improving perceived front-end performance.
* Options in [timezones selector are now grouped by regions](https://www.drupal.org/node/2847651)
  and labeled by cities instead of timezone names, making it much easier for users to find and select the specific timezone they need.
* Both the ["Comments" administration page at `/admin/content/comment`](https://www.drupal.org/node/1986606) and the ["Recent log messages" report provided by dblog](https://www.drupal.org/node/2015149) are now configurable views.
* Useful meta information about a node's status is typically displayed at the
  top of the node sidebar. Previously, this meta information was provided by
  the Seven theme, so it was not available in other administrative themes.
  [This meta information is now provided by node.module itself](https://www.drupal.org/node/2803875)
  so other administration themes can access it.

### REST and API-first improvements

* Authenticated REST API performance increased by 15% by
  [utilizing the Dynamic Page Cache](https://www.drupal.org/node/2827797).
* POSTing entities [can now happen at `/node`, `/taxonomy/term` and so on](https://www.drupal.org/node/2293697),
  instead of `/entity/node`, `/entity/taxonomy_term`. Instead of confusingly
  different URLs, they therefore now use the URLs you'd expect. Backwards
  compatibility is maintained.
* There is now a dedicated resource for [resetting a user's password](https://www.drupal.org/node/2847708).
* Time fields now are [normalized to RFC3339 timestamps by default](https://www.drupal.org/node/2768651), fixing
  time ambiguity. Existing sites continue to receive UNIX timestamps, but can
  opt in. [See the change record for more information about backwards compatibility and on how to opt in](https://www.drupal.org/node/2859657).
* [Path alias fields now are normalized too](https://www.drupal.org/node/2846554).
  [See the change record for information about how this impacts API-first modules and other features relying on serialized entities](https://www.drupal.org/node/2856220).
* When denormalization fails, a [422 response is now returned](https://www.drupal.org/node/2827084)
  instead of a 400, per the HTTP specification.
* With CORS enabled to allow origins besides the site's own host,
  [submitting forms was broken](https://www.drupal.org/node/2853201) unless the
  site's own host was also explicitly allowed.
* Fatal errors and exceptions [now show a backtrace](https://www.drupal.org/node/2853300)
  for all non-HTML requests as well as HTML requests, which makes for easier
  debugging and better bug reports.
* Massive expansion of test coverage.

### Performance and scalability improvements

* The internal page cache now [has a dedicated cache bin](https://www.drupal.org/node/2889603)
  distinct from the rest of the render cache (a significant scalability
  improvement).
* The service collector pattern instantiates all services it collects, which is expensive, and unnecessary for some use cases.   For those use cases, a [new service ID collector](https://www.drupal.org/node/2472337)
  pattern was added. The theme negotiator was updated to use it.
  [See the change record for information about how to use the service ID collector](https://www.drupal.org/node/2598944) for improved performance.
* The maximum time in-progress forms are cached [is now customizable](https://www.drupal.org/node/1286154)
  rather than being limited to a default cache lifetime of 6 hours. Sites can
  decrease the lifetime to reduce cache footprint, or increase it if needed for
  a particular site's usecase.
  [See the change record to learn how to access this new setting](https://www.drupal.org/node/2886836).
* If there are no status messages, the corresponding rendering
  [is now skipped](https://www.drupal.org/node/2853509). On simple sites, this
  can result in a 10% improvement when there are no messages!
* [Optimized the early Drupal installer](https://www.drupal.org/node/2872611)
  to check whether any themes are installed first before invoking an
  unnecessary function, which improves Drupal install time measurably for
  both sites and automated tests.

### Developer experience improvements

* [Adopted Airbnb JavaScript style guide 14.1](https://www.drupal.org/node/2815077) as the new baseline set of
  coding standards for Drupal core and contributed modules.
  [See the change record for information about how to configure your project for eslint](https://www.drupal.org/node/2873849).
* Field type definitions can now [enforce the cardinality of the field](https://www.drupal.org/node/2403703).
  [See the change record for information about how to specify a cardinality via the annotation](https://www.drupal.org/node/2869873).
* [Added new methods](https://www.drupal.org/node/2869809) to make getting
  typed configuration entity representations easier.
  [See the change record for more information about how to invoke these methods](https://www.drupal.org/node/2877282).
* The `html_tag` render element now [supports nested render arrays](https://www.drupal.org/node/2694535),
  enabling the creation of dynamic SVGs.
  [See the change record for information about how you can use this in your theme](https://www.drupal.org/node/2887146).
* [Added more helpful errors](https://www.drupal.org/node/2705037) when CSS
  is not properly nested under an existing category in asset libraries.
* Also see the [change records for the 8.4.x branch](https://www.drupal.org/list-changes/drupal/published?keywords_description=&to_branch=8.4.x&version=&created_op=%3E%3D&created%5Bvalue%5D=&created%5Bmin%5D=&created%5Bmax%5D=)
  for other changes for developers.

### Automated testing improvements

* [PHPUnit has been updated from 4.8.28 to 4.8.35](https://www.drupal.org/node/2850797)
  in order to incorporate a forward compatibility layer for PHPUnit 4.8, useful
  during a future migration to PHPUnit 5 or PHPUnit 6.
* Many former WebTestBase tests were converted to BrowserTestBase.
  [Track current progress](http://simpletest-countdown.org/).
* The default approach for testing deprecated code has changed to
  [require use of the Drupal core deprecation policy](https://www.drupal.org/node/2488860)
  (`@trigger_error()`) to mark code deprecated; otherwise a test error will
  be thrown.
  [See the change record for information about how to update `phpunit.xml` and how to test deprecated code](https://www.drupal.org/node/2811561).
* [Resolved random test failures](https://www.drupal.org/node/2866056) due to
  ResourceTestBase's HTTP client timeout of 30 seconds.

### Third-party library updates

* [Drupal's Symfony dependency has been updated from Symfony 2.8 to Symfony
  3.2](https://www.drupal.org/node/2712647). This major version update is
  necessary because Symfony 2.8 support will end around the release of Drupal
  8.6.0 next year. See the change record for information about [Symfony 3 backwards compatibility
  breaks that affected Drupal core](https://www.drupal.org/node/2743809).
  [Drupal 8 also requires Symfony 3.2.8](https://www.drupal.org/node/2871253)
  because of a bug in Symfony 3.2.7.
* [#2533498: Update jQuery to version 3](https://www.drupal.org/node/2533498).
  Now that jQuery 3.0 has been released, jQuery 2.x will only be receiving
  security updates, so Drupal 8.4.0 ships with this library update. jQuery 3
  features numerous improvements, including better error reporting. See the
  [jQuery Core 3.0 Upgrade Guide](https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/) for
  information on jQuery 3 backwards compatibility breaks that might affect the
  JavaScript code in your modules, themes, and sites. Note that we may consider
  rolling back this library update if the [bug affecting tours](https://www.drupal.org/node/2898808) is not resolved in time for Drupal 8.4.0-beta1.
* [zendframework/zend-diactoros has been updated from 1.3.10 to 1.4.0](https://www.drupal.org/node/2874817).
* [jQuery UI has been updated from 1.11.4 to 1.12.1](https://www.drupal.org/node/2809427).
* [CKEditor has been updated from 4.6.2 to 4.7.1](https://www.drupal.org/node/2893566).
* [asm89/stack-cors has been updated from 1.0 to 1.1](https://www.drupal.org/node/2853201).

### Experimental modules

#### Migrate ([beta stability](https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#beta))

Migrate provides a general API for migrations. It will be considered completely
stable once all  issues tagged [Migrate critical](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&status%5B%5D=Open&version%5B%5D=8.x&issue_tags_op=%3D&issue_tags=Migrate+critical) are resolved.

* Renamed [`migration` process plugin to `migration_lookup`](https://www.drupal.org/node/2845486)
  and
  [`iterator` process plugin to `sub_process`](https://www.drupal.org/node/2845483)
  to better capture their purposes. (Backwards compatibility is provided for
  both process plugins since Migrate is in beta.)

#### Migrate Drupal and Migrate Drupal UI ([alpha stability](https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#alpha))

Migrate Drupal module provides API support for Drupal-to-Drupal migrations, and
Migrate Drupal UI offers a simple user interface to run migrations from older
Drupal versions.

* This release adds [date](https://www.drupal.org/node/2566779) and
  [node reference](https://www.drupal.org/node/2814949) support for Drupal 6 to
  8 migrations.
* Core provides migrations for most Drupal 6 data and can be used for migrating
  Drupal 6 sites to Drupal 8, and the Drupal 6 to 8 migration path is nearing
  beta stability. Some gaps remain, such as for some internationalization data.
  ([Outstanding issues for the Drupal 6 to Drupal 8 migration](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&status%5B%5D=1&status%5B%5D=13&status%5B%5D=8&status%5B%5D=14&status%5B%5D=15&status%5B%5D=4&issue_tags_op=%3D&issue_tags=migrate-d6-d8))
* The Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 migration is incomplete but is suitable for
  developers who would like to help improve the migration and can be used to
  test upgrades especially for simple Drupal 7 sites. Most high-priority
  migrations are available.
  ([Outstanding issues for the Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 migration](https://www.drupal.org/node/2456259))
* Drush support for Migrate is currently only available in the
  [Drupal Upgrade](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_upgrade) contributed
  module. (See the
  [pull request to add support to Drush](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/issues/2140).)
* [Added field plugin](https://www.drupal.org/node/2814949) to handle
  migration of node reference field values from Drupal 6 to Drupal 8.
* [Added date field plugin](https://www.drupal.org/node/2566779) to handle
  migration of CCK date fields in Drupal 6 to Drupal 8.
* [Renamed migration field plugins and classes](https://www.drupal.org/node/2683435)
  referring to custom fields provided by the Drupal 6 module CCK, which was
  replaced in Drupal 7 by the core Field API. [See the change record for more information about how this impacts your migration plugins](https://www.drupal.org/node/2751897).

#### Workflows ([beta stability](https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#beta))

The Workflows module provides an abstract system of states (like Draft,
Archived, and Published) and transitions between them. Workflows can be used by
modules that implement non-publishing workflows (such as for users or products)
as well as content publishing workflows.

Drupal 8.4 introduces a final significant backwards compatibility and data
model break for this module,
[moving responsibility for workflow states and transitions from the Workflow entity to the Workflow type plugin](https://www.drupal.org/node/2849827).
Read [Workflow type plugins are now responsible for state and transition schema](https://www.drupal.org/node/2897706)
for full details on the API and data model changes related to this fix. Now
that this change is complete, the Workflows module has reached beta stability,
and it may furthermore be marked stable in time for Drupal 8.4.0!

#### Content Moderation ([beta stability](https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#beta))

Content Moderation allows workflows from the Workflows module to be applied to
content. Content Moderation has beta stability in 8.4.0-alpha1, but may become
stable in time for 8.4.0! Notable improvements in this release:

* Workflow states are now [selected from a select list, rather than under a drop-button](https://www.drupal.org/node/2753717), which represents a significant
  usability improvement.
* Now that workflows can be applied to any revisionable entity type, Content
  Moderation [adds entity type checkboxes to the workflow form](https://www.drupal.org/node/2843083).
  This allows site administrators to configure which entity types should have
  the workflow at the same time as they configure the workflow itself, for a
  more intuitive user experience.
* Content Moderation now [prevents the deletion of workflows that are currently in use](https://www.drupal.org/node/2830740)
  to prevent fatal errors and data integrity problems.
* The confusing terminology of
  ["forward revisions" has been replaced with that of "pending revisions"](https://www.drupal.org/node/2890364).
  If your contributed module refers to revisions that are not yet published, it
  should use this new term.

#### Field Layout ([alpha stability](https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#alpha))

This module provides the ability for site builders to rearrange fields on
content types, block types, etc. into new regions, for both the form and
display, on the same forms provided by the normal field user interface.  Field
Layout has had several bugfixes since 8.3.0, but no significant changes. See
the [entity display layout roadmap](https://www.drupal.org/node/2795833) for
the next steps for this module, which needs to become stable by 8.5.0 to remain
in Drupal core.

#### Settings Tray ([alpha stability](https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#alpha))

The Settings Tray module allows configuring page elements such as blocks and
menus from the frontend of your site. Settings Tray has improved significantly
since Drupal 8.3.0. The goal for this release is to get Settings Tray to beta
stability. Only two issues remain before that milestone: to
[move the off-canvas dialog renderer into a core component](https://www.drupal.org/node/2784443), and to
[rename the machine name of the module to settings_tray](https://www.drupal.org/node/2803375),
to match its user-facing name. We hope to make Settings Tray stable by 8.5.0.
To track progress, see the ["outside in" roadmap issue](https://www.drupal.org/node/2762505).

* [A CSS reset has been added to the Settings Tray](https://www.drupal.org/node/2826722) to improve the themer experience.
* Form validation messages now [appear in the Settings Tray instead of main page](https://www.drupal.org/node/2785047).
* [The toolbar background in Edit mode now matches the edit button](https://www.drupal.org/node/2894427),
  instead of the white background that many users found distracting or
  misunderstood to be an indication that something was broken.
* The block title field in the tray is now [labeled more clearly and only shown when the block title itself is shown](https://www.drupal.org/node/2882729).
* In the contextual links, ["Quick edit" is now listed before "Configure"](https://www.drupal.org/node/2784567),
  and the [custom blocks instead have a "Quick edit settings" link](https://www.drupal.org/node/2786193)
  (to distinguish them from the links provided by the Quick Edit module, which
  allow editing the content of the custom block itself).
* Edit mode [now behaves the same way whether accessed by clicking "Quick edit" or clicking through the toolbar](https://www.drupal.org/node/2847664)
* Users can now [escape from Edit mode with the ESC key](https://www.drupal.org/node/2784571), for better accessibility.

#### Place Blocks ([alpha stability](https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#alpha))

This feature allows the user to place a block on any page and see the region
where it will be displayed, without having to navigate to a backend
administration form.
[8.4.0-alpha1 was the deadline for Place Blocks to stabilize](https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#versions),
but the module's roadmap was not completed. Furthermore, the module is not
intended as a standalone feature and should instead be a built-in part of the
Block system. For these reasons,
[Place Blocks module has been marked hidden in this release](https://www.drupal.org/node/2898267)
(it can still be enabled with Drush). The Place Blocks module itself will be
turned into an empty module in Drupal 8.5.x, since ideally the core Block
system will offer the same functionality in 8.5.0 (though this depends on
completion of a [core patch for the feature](https://www.drupal.org/node/2739075).)


Drupal 8.3.0, 2017-04-05
------------------------
- Added modules:
    * Added the Workflows module (experimental) which abstracts transitions and
      states from Content Moderation into a separate component for reuse by
      other modules implementing non-publishing workflows.
    * Added the Layout Discovery module (experimental) which provides an API for
      modules or themes to register layouts.
    * Added the Field Layout module (experimental) which provides the ability
      for site builders to rearrange fields on content types, block types, etc.
      into new regions, for both the form and display, on the same forms
      provided by the normal field user interface.

      mobile clients are not offered a confusing and non-functional video
      upload option.
    * CKEditor now utilizes the AutoGrow plugin to better take advantage of
      larger screen sizes.
- Improved site building and administration:
    * Redesigned status report.

      request headers or request bodies, in dozens of situations.
    * Massive overhaul of the test coverage.
    * 403 responses now return reason why access was denied.
    * Serialized values for Booleans and integers are now returned as the
      correct data type, rather than incorrectly typed as strings.
- Improved performance/scalability:
    * Optimized class loader detection made more generic to support class
      loaders other than ApcClassLoader.

    * Deprecated several routing services in favor of two more unified services.
    * Replaced the deprecated Symfony ExecutionContextInterface by subclassing
      from ConstraintValidator to prepare for an update to Symfony 3.
    * EntityPublishedInterface and EntityPublishedTrait have been added to give
      a generic publishing API, and are being used by Node and Comment entity
      types.

- Changed coding standards:
    * Officially adopted short array syntax and updated all of core accordingly.
    * PHP CodeSniffer and Drupal Coder have been added as composer dev
      requirements, so they can be installed automatically with

      not use `composer install --dev` for production sites.)
    * Most global constants in Drupal 8 have been deprecated in favor of class
      constants. As a best practice, use appropriate class constants rather than
      global constants.

    * Added an edit tab to taxonomy term pages.
    * Redesigned password strength validator.
    * Redesigned the add content type screen.
    * Highlight duplicate URL aliases.
    * Renamed "input formats" to "text formats".
    * Moved text format permissions to the main permissions page.
    * Added configurable ability for users to cancel their own accounts.
    * Added "vertical tabs", a reusable interface component that features
      automatic summaries and increases usability.
    * Replaced fieldsets on node edit and add pages with vertical tabs.
- Performance:
    * Improved performance on uncached page views by loading multiple core
      objects in a single database query.
    * Improved performance for logged-in users by reducing queries for path
      alias lookups.
    * Improved support for HTTP proxies (including reverse proxies), allowing
      anonymous page views to be served entirely from the proxy.
- Documentation:
    * Hook API documentation now included in Drupal core.
- News aggregator:
    * Added OPML import functionality for RSS feeds.
    * Optionally, RSS feeds may be configured to not automatically generate feed blocks.
- Search:
    * Added support for language-aware searches.
- Aggregator:
    * Introduced architecture that allows pluggable parsers and processors for
      syndicating RSS and Atom feeds.
    * Added options to suspend updating specific feeds and never discard feeds
      items.
- Testing:
    * Added test framework and tests.
- Improved time zone support:
    * Drupal now uses PHP's time zone database when rendering dates in local
      time. Site-wide and user-configured time zone offsets have been converted
      to time zone names; for example, Africa/Abidjan.
    * In some cases the upgrade and install scripts do not choose the preferred
      site default time zone. The automatically-selected time zone can be
      corrected at admin/config/regional/settings.
    * If your site is being upgraded from Drupal 6 and you do not have the
      contributed date or event modules installed, user time zone settings will
      fallback to the system time zone and will have to be reconfigured by each user.
    * User-configured time zones now serve as the default time zone for PHP
      date/time functions.
- Filter system:
    * Revamped the filter API and text format storage.
    * Added support for default text formats to be assigned on a per-role basis.
    * Refactored the HTML corrector to take advantage of PHP 5 features.
- User system:
    * Added clean API functions for creating, loading, updating, and deleting
      user roles and permissions.
    * Refactored the "access rules" component of user module: The user module
      now provides a simple interface for blocking single IP addresses. The
      previous functionality in the user module for restricting certain email
      addresses and usernames is now available as a contributed module. Further,
      IP address range blocking is no longer supported and should be implemented
      at the operating system level.
    * Removed per-user themes: Contributed modules with similar functionality
      are available.
- OpenID:
    * Added support for Gmail and Google Apps for Domain identifiers. Users can
      now log in with their user@example.com identifier when example.com is
      powered by Google.
    * Made the OpenID module more pluggable.
- Added code registry:
    * Using the registry, modules declare their includable files via their .info file,
      allowing Drupal to lazy-load classes and interfaces as needed.
- Theme system:
    * Removed the Bluemarine, Chameleon and Pushbutton themes. These themes live
      on as contributed themes (https://www.drupal.org/project/bluemarine,
      https://www.drupal.org/project/chameleon and
      https://www.drupal.org/project/pushbutton).
    * Added Stark theme to make analyzing Drupal's default HTML and CSS easier.
    * Added Seven as the default administration theme.
    * Variable preprocessing of theme hooks prior to template rendering now goes
      through two phases: a 'preprocess' phase and a new 'process' phase. See
      http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme/7 for details.
    * Theme hooks implemented as functions (rather than as templates) can now
      also have preprocess (and process) functions. See
      http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme/7 for details.
    * Added Bartik as the default theme.
- File handling:
    * Files are now first class Drupal objects with file_load(), file_save(),
      and file_validate() functions and corresponding hooks.
    * The file_move(), file_copy() and file_delete() functions now operate on
      file objects and invoke file hooks so that modules are notified and can
      respond to changes.
    * For the occasions when only basic file manipulation are needed--such as
      uploading a site logo--that don't require the overhead of databases and
      hooks, the current unmanaged copy, move and delete operations have been
      preserved but renamed to file_unmanaged_*().
    * Rewrote file handling to use PHP stream wrappers to enable support for
      both public and private files and to support pluggable storage mechanisms
      and access to remote resources (for example, S3 storage or Flickr photos).
    * The mime_extension_mapping variable has been removed. Modules that need to
      alter the default MIME type extension mappings should implement
      hook_file_mimetype_mapping_alter().
    * Added the hook_file_url_alter() hook, which makes it possible to serve
      files from a CDN.
    * Added a field specifically for uploading files, previously provided by
      the contributed module FileField.
- Image handling:
    * Improved image handling, including better support for add-on image
      libraries.
    * Added API and interface for creating advanced image thumbnails.
    * Inclusion of additional effects such as rotate and desaturate.
    * Added a field specifically for uploading images, previously provided by
      the contributed module ImageField.
- Added aliased multi-site support:
    * Added support for mapping domain names to sites directories.
- Added RDF support:
    * Modules can declare RDF namespaces which are serialized in the <html> tag
      for RDFa support.
    * Modules can specify how their data structure maps to RDF.
    * Added support for RDFa export of nodes, comments, terms, users, etc. and
      their fields.
- Search engine optimization and web linking:
    * Added a rel="canonical" link on node and comment pages to prevent
      duplicate content indexing by search engines.
    * Added a default rel="shortlink" link on node and comment pages that
      advertises a short link as an alternative URL to third-party services.
    * Meta information is now alterable by all modules before rendering.
- Field API:
    * Custom data fields may be attached to nodes, users, comments and taxonomy
      terms.
    * Node bodies and teasers are now Field API fields instead of
      being a hard-coded property of node objects.
    * In addition, any other object type may register with Field API
      and allow custom data fields to be attached to itself.
    * Provides most of the features of the former Content Construction
      Kit (CCK) module.
    * Taxonomy terms are now Field API fields that can be added to any fieldable
      object.
- Installer:
    * Refactored the installer into an API that allows Drupal to be installed
      via a command line script.
- Page organization
    * Made the help text area a full featured region with blocks.
    * Site mission is replaced with the highlighted content block region and
      separate RSS feed description settings.
    * The footer message setting was removed in favor of custom blocks.
    * Made the main page content a block which can be moved and ordered
      with other blocks in the same region.
    * Blocks can now return structured arrays for later rendering just
      like page callbacks.
- Translation system
    * The translation system now supports message context (msgctxt).
    * Added support for translatable fields to Field API.
- JavaScript changes
    * Upgraded the core JavaScript library to jQuery version 1.4.4.
    * Upgraded the jQuery Forms library to 2.52.
    * Added jQuery UI 1.8.7, which allows improvements to Drupal's user
      experience.
- Better module version support
    * Modules now can specify which version of another module they depend on.
- Removed modules from core
    * The following modules have been removed from core, because contributed
      modules with similar functionality are available:
      * Blog API module
      * Ping module
      * Throttle module
- Improved node access control system.
    * All modules may now influence the access to a node at runtime, not just
      the module that defined a node.
    * Users may now be allowed to bypass node access restrictions without giving
      them complete access to the site.
    * Access control affects both published and unpublished nodes.
    * Numerous other improvements to the node access system.
- Actions system
    * Simplified definitions of actions and triggers.
    * Removed dependency on the combination of hooks and operations. Triggers
      now directly map to module hooks.

    * Added queue API support to cron API.
    * Added a locking framework to coordinate long-running operations across
      requests.

- New watchdog as a hook functionality.
   * New hook_watchdog that can be implemented by any module to route log
     messages to various destinations.
   * Expands the severity levels from 3 (Error, Warning, Notice) to the 8
     levels defined in RFC 3164.

    * Story sections make the open submission more adaptive in that you can set individual post, dump and expiration thresholds for each section according to the story type and urgency level: stories in certain sections do not "expire" and might stay interesting and active as time passes by, whereas news-related stories are only considered "hot" over a short period of time.
- Multiple vhosts + multiple directories:
    * You can set up multiple Drupal sites on top of the same physical source tree either by using vhosts or sub-directories.

- Added "search infrastructure":
    * Improved search page and integrated search functionality in the administration pages.
- Added translation / localization / internationalization support:

- Added fine-grained user permission (or group) system:
    * Users can be granted access to specific administration sections. Example: a FAQ maintainer can be given access to maintain the FAQ and translators can be given access to the translation pages.
