/**
 * Stores PHP code in files with securely hashed names.
 *
 * The goal of this class is to ensure that if a PHP file is replaced with
 * an untrusted one, it does not get loaded. Since mtime granularity is 1
 * second, we cannot prevent an attack that happens within one second of the
 * initial save(). However, it is very unlikely for an attacker exploiting an
 * upload or file write vulnerability to also know when a legitimate file is
 * being saved, discover its hash, undo its file permissions, and override the
 * file with an upload all within a single second. Being able to accomplish
 * that would indicate a site very likely vulnerable to many other attack
 * vectors.
 *
 * Each file is stored in its own unique containing directory. The hash is based
 * on the virtual file name, the containing directory's mtime, and a
 * cryptographically hard to guess secret string. Thus, even if the hashed file
 * name is discovered and replaced by an untrusted file (e.g., via a
 * move_uploaded_file() invocation by a script that performs insufficient
 * validation), the directory's mtime gets updated in the process, invalidating
 * the hash and preventing the untrusted file from getting loaded.
 *
 * This class does not protect against overwriting a file in-place (e.g. a
 * malicious module that does a file_put_contents()) since this will not change
 * the mtime of the directory. MTimeProtectedFileStorage protects against this
 * at the cost of an additional system call for every load() and exists().
 *
 * The containing directory is created with the same name as the virtual file
 * name (slashes removed) to assist with debugging, since the file itself is
 * stored with a name that's meaningless to humans.
