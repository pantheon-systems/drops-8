 * provides a store for known safe strings and methods to manage them
 * throughout the page request.
 *
 * Strings sanitized by self::checkPlain() and self::escape() are automatically
 * marked safe, as are markup strings created from @link theme_render render
 * arrays @endlink via drupal_render().
 *
 * This class should be limited to internal use only. Module developers should
 * instead use the appropriate
 * @link sanitization sanitization functions @endlink or the
 * @link theme_render theme and render systems @endlink so that the output can
 * can be themed, escaped, and altered properly.
