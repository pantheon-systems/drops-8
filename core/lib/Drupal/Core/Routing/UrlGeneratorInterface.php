  /**
   * Generates an internal or external URL.
   *
   * @param string $path
   *   (optional) The internal path or external URL being linked to, such as
   *   "node/34" or "http://example.com/foo". The default value is equivalent to
   *   passing in '<front>'. A few notes:
   *   - If you provide a full URL, it will be considered an external URL.
   *   - If you provide only the path (e.g. "node/34"), it will be
   *     considered an internal link. In this case, it should be a system URL,
   *     and it will be replaced with the alias, if one exists. Additional query
   *     arguments for internal paths must be supplied in $options['query'], not
   *     included in $path.
   *   - If you provide an internal path and $options['alias'] is set to TRUE, the
   *     path is assumed already to be the correct path alias, and the alias is
   *     not looked up.
   *   - The special string '<front>' generates a link to the site's base URL.
   *   - If your external URL contains a query (e.g. http://example.com/foo?a=b),
   *     then you can either URL encode the query keys and values yourself and
   *     include them in $path, or use $options['query'] to let this method
   *     URL encode them.
   *
   * @param array $options
   *   (optional) An associative array of additional options, with the following
   *   elements:
   *   - 'query': An array of query key/value-pairs (without any URL-encoding) to
   *     append to the URL.
   *   - 'fragment': A fragment identifier (named anchor) to append to the URL.
   *     Do not include the leading '#' character.
   *   - 'absolute': Defaults to FALSE. Whether to force the output to be an
   *     absolute link (beginning with http:). Useful for links that will be
   *     displayed outside the site, such as in an RSS feed.
   *   - 'alias': Defaults to FALSE. Whether the given path is a URL alias
   *     already.
   *   - 'external': Whether the given path is an external URL.
   *   - 'language': An optional language object. If the path being linked to is
   *     internal to the site, $options['language'] is used to look up the alias
   *     for the URL. If $options['language'] is omitted, the language will be
   *     obtained from
   *     \Drupal::languageManager()->getCurrentLanguage(LanguageInterface::TYPE_URL).
   *   - 'https': Whether this URL should point to a secure location. If not
   *     defined, the current scheme is used, so the user stays on HTTP or HTTPS
   *     respectively. TRUE enforces HTTPS and FALSE enforces HTTP.
   *   - 'base_url': Only used internally by a path processor, for example, to
   *     modify the base URL when a language dependent URL requires so.
   *   - 'prefix': Only used internally, to modify the path when a language
   *     dependent URL requires so.
   *   - 'script': Added to the URL between the base path and the path prefix.
   *     Defaults to empty string when clean URLs are in effect, and to
   *     'index.php/' when they are not.
   *   - 'entity_type': The entity type of the object that called _url(). Only
   *     set if _url() is invoked by Drupal\Core\Entity\Entity::uri().
   *   - 'entity': The entity object (such as a node) for which the URL is being
   *     generated. Only set if _url() is invoked by Drupal\Core\Entity\Entity::uri().
   * @param bool $collect_cacheability_metadata
   *   (optional) Defaults to FALSE. When TRUE, both the generated URL and its
   *   associated cacheability metadata are returned.
   *
   * @return string|\Drupal\Core\GeneratedUrl
   *   A string containing a URL to the given path.
   *   When $collect_cacheability_metadata is TRUE, a GeneratedUrl object is
   *   returned, containing the generated URL plus cacheability metadata.
   *
   * @throws \Drupal\Core\Routing\GeneratorNotInitializedException.
   *
   * @deprecated in Drupal 8.0.x-dev and will be removed before Drupal 8.0.0.
   *   To generate URLs for Drupal routes (that is, most pages generated by
   *   Drupal), see UrlGeneratorInterface::generateFromRoute() instead. For
   *   non-routed local URIs relative to the base path (like robots.txt) see
   *   \Drupal\Core\Utility\UnroutedUrlAssembler.
   *
   * @see static::generateFromRoute()
