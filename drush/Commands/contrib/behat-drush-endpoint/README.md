The Behat Drush Endpoint is the remote component needed to work with the [Behat Drupal Driver](https://github.com/jhedstrom/DrupalDriver).

The Behat Drupal Driver contains three drivers:  *Blackbox*, *Direct Drupal API*, and *Drush*.  The Behat Drush Endpoint is only necessary when using the *Drush* driver.

## Installation Instructions

THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR:

- DRUSH 10
- DRUSH 9
- DRUSH 8.2.0+

If you are using an earlier version of Drush 8, please switch to the 8.x branch.

If you are managing your Drupal site with Composer, then add the Behat Drush Endpoint to your project as follows:
```bash
composer require drush-ops/behat-drush-endpoint:^9
```
If you are not using composer.json on the remote Drupal site, then copy the entire contents of this project to either **__ROOT__**/drush or **__ROOT__**/sites/all/drush, then `cd behat-drush-endpoint` and run `composer install`.
